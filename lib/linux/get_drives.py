	********* THIS SCRIPT RETURNS A VARIABLE CONTAINING DISK INFO IN HUMAN READABLE FORMT *********
	CLASS get_drives DOCINFO:
	get_drives HAVE TWO FUNCTIONS I.E.,
	1) __init__
	2) work()
		
		__init__ DOCFILE: 
			__init__ BLOCK SERVES THE INITIALIZATION FUNCTION, CONTAINING INITIALIZED VARIABLES WHICH IS GOING TO BE USED LATER BY OTHER MEMBER FUNCTION.
		
		WORK() DOCFILE:
			THE FUNCTION WORKS IN FOLLOWING WAY:
			1) COLLECTING DATA FROM COMMANDLINE, AND SAVING IT INTO A LIST.
			2) REMOVING REDUNDANT DATA FROM LIST, AND MAKING SUBLIST OF ITEMS SO THAT THEY CAN BE USED  LATER AS A SINGLE VARIABLE.
			3) COLLECTING NAME OF ALL PARTITIONS AND CREATING A LIST OF AVAILABLE DISKS FROM PARTITIONS.
			4) FINDING THE DISK AND PARTITION ON DISK HAVING LINUX BOOT FILES.
			5) SAVING THE REFINED DATA IN A TABULAR FORMAT IN A SINGLE VARIABLE
			6) RETURNING THE OBTAINED DATA IN A STRING VARIABLE.
